# NUMBERSTORM

## [Live Link](https://numberstorm.herokuapp.com/)

This is a small project I built, built on React/Redux/HTML/CSS, based on the Math game of 24.

In 24, you are given 4 numbers, and you need to make 24 out of them.

For example, if the 4 numbers are 5 , 2 , 3 , 5...

Then one solution would be (5 - 2) * ( 3 + 5 ) === 3 * 8 === 24.

I built a backend on Rails, which is hosted on a seperate Heroku. The backend handles all of the solution calculation and storage. 

Here is the link to the github repo for the backend:
